About FireflyMesh

FireflyMesh started as a way to pull together all the scattered information about these little LoRa devices. A lot of it is tucked away in random GitHub comments or threads, and honestly it can take a bit to piece together what you actually need to do. My goal was to put everything in one place so anyone can get these devices running on a Meshtastic network without bouncing around the internet for a whole weekend and ordering the wrong parts.

And if you want to incorporate these into a STEM class or say a scout group, the next step is figuring out how to harden them so they’re safe. That part matters, because you don’t want kids drifting onto the public mesh or strangers trying to ping their devices. It doesn’t have to be complicated, just practical and predictable.

FireflyMesh is an open-source LoRa mesh communicator project meant for personal tinkering, group projects, and hands-on learning. It builds on Meshtastic and focuses on low-power handhelds like the Chatter 2.0. The whole point is to make mesh networking approachable, something you can mess with on a weekend or bring into a workshop without needing a full radio background.

This is a community project. It isn’t connected to CircuitMess, Meshtastic LLC, or any scouting organization.
